# Module 2: Challenge 2: Create a professional portfolio
This week's challenge focused on creating an online portfolio to showcase ourselves to potential employers. We took all our knowledge from the past two weeks of HTML, CSS, flexbox, and media queries to create a web portfolio for potential employers to see.

<b>The user's story is as follows:</b><br>
AS AN employer<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

<b>The acceptance criteria is as follows:</b><br>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>
