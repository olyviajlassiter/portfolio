        <div class="about-bio">
            <p>
            I am currently an Executive Leader for Target's Food & Beverage department, with nearly five years of experience managing teams upwards of 60 members. In 2021 I ran a $32 million dollar business, contributing to 30% of total sales, all the while pivoting to everyday changes during a global pandemic and global supply chain issues.<br><br>
            I am passionate about building teams through engagement, culture, and development. Since working for Target I have had the opportunity to be a mentor, district trainer, and part of leader developmental programs. Everyday that my team comes together to celebrate wins is another day I have been fulfilled in my leadership role. <br><br>
            I have been in the retail industry for 10 years, with 8 years of leadership and management experience. I am a graduate of the University of North Texas with a B.S. in Fashion Merchandising. I began my Target career as an intern and was hired on directly after the program ended. I began my career with the role of Specialty Sales Executive Leader, followed by Service & Engagement Executive Leader, and currently Food & Beverage Executive Leader. I believe my tenacity and grit has allowed me to grow into a strong leader of my field.<br><br>
            I am currently enrolled at Michigan State University in a coding bootcamp to futher my education and enter a workforce with ample opportunities to expand and grow. I am looking for the chance to enter the tech work field to merge my love of fashion and web design.
